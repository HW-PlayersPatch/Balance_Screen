# Balance Screen
The Balance Screen is used to spawn units and test them in combat.
It only works with the internal developer build of HWR, by using the -balance command line.

# Tips
Be sure to set player 1 and player 2 to the races you want to test, and enable "Complete Research". If player 1 is vaygr, and you spawn Hiigaran units, the proper research will not be applied.
Sometimes the AI puts units into formations on its own, so watch battles carefully and redo tests as needed. (Fear may have prevented this as of March 2020)
Test each matchup equally between P1 vs P2 and P2 vs P1. P1 tends to be favored for unknown reasons.
